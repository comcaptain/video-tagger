## Tags would be used in three places

### In adding new screenshot screen
- Initial tag list is empty
- New tag is possible
- Shouldn't have video count for current tags
- Nice to have but not necessary to have video count in tag hint
- Tag hint can be a big box
- Has remove button

### In screenshot detail screen
- Initial tag list is not empty
- New tag is possible
- Shouldn't have video count for current tags
- Nice to have but not necessary to have video count in tag hint
- Tag hint can be a big box
- Has remove button

### In search screen
- Necessary to have video count for current tags

Initially, there are no tags on the screen. Pressing `T` would show add tag input box on the screen, with all tags listed in a big box under input box

### In video component
- Shouldn't have video count for current tags
- No remove button
- No hint

### In tags screen
- Has remove button
- No hint
- Necessary to have video count for current tags
It should be a left-floating stream of tag boxes, with name, video count and a delete button. Clicking the delete button would prompt a confirm box, and tag would be removed if user clicks yes.
